# svgToKeyshape

Keyshape doesn't support SVG filters used by Sketch, but it's possible to use CSS instead.

This plugin convert : 

- SVG drop shadow filter into drop-shadow CSS 
- SVG blur filter into Blur CSS   
- Text and Tspan elements into many Text elements, each new Text element has their own origin (it's more simple to edit it into Keyshape)
